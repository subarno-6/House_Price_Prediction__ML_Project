# House_Price_Prediction__ML_Project

House price predictive model using python and supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Linear Regression and XGBoost Regression.


This is a dataset which consists information about the location of the house ,price and other aspects such as square feet etc. When we work on these sort of data , we need to see which column is important for us and which is not.

We are going to use Linear Regression for this dataset and see if it gives us a good accuracy or not.It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis.

Here I have used another regression algorithm XGboost.Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an open-source library that provides an efficient and effective implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm.There are several metrics involved in regression like root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean-squared-error (MAE). These are some key members of XGBoost models, each plays an important role.
